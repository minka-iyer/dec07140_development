                <h2>1. Alignment with Client and User Needs</h2>
                <h3>1.1 Client Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    The Connect Communities Initiative (CCI) aims to foster a
                    sense of digital belonging, wellbeing, and collaboration
                    through accessible online experiences. Its mission is to
                    create a safe digital space where users can share their
                    experiences openly, connect with peers, and alleviate
                    feelings of isolation.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Represent and celebrate the identity of the chosen
                        community, recognising and representing diversity rather
                        than relying on stereotypes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide clear, accessible information and resources to
                        users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Foster meaningful connections and support within the
                        community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure ethical, inclusive, and culturally sensitive
                        design principles are upheld.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    My website meets these needs through a twofold strategy:
                    <strong>(a)</strong> providing practical information to
                    clients on building their portfolio through completing
                    challenges posted by employers, and
                    <strong>(b)</strong> creating a space for them to share
                    their experiences and connect with other members of
                    innovating communities through stories.
                </p>

                <h3>1.2 User Needs Identified in A3 Design Proposal</h3>
                <p>
                    Users wanted to showcase their work outside conventional
                    means such as formal portfolios. The Employer Challenges
                    page connects them directly with employers through
                    project-based challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A strong need for easy-to-understand resources without
                    jargon was identified, so the site was arranged intuitively,
                    with concise language and a welcoming space for users to
                    share stories or questions without fear of “sounding
                    stupid.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interface was designed with calm colour gradients,
                    golden-ratio spacing, and ambient hover feedback to promote
                    focus. Typography was updated to
                    <strong>Antonio</strong> for its futuristic yet readable
                    form and <strong>Lexend</strong> for clarity and
                    approachability.
                </p>

                <h3>1.3 Alignment with CCI Goals</h3>

                <h2>2. Accessibility and Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <h3>2.1 Accessibility Integration</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>WCAG 2.1 AA compliance</li>
                    <li>Alt text for all imagery</li>
                    <li>
                        Sufficient colour contrast (tested with ratio tools)
                    </li>
                    <li>Keyboard and screen-reader compatibility</li>
                    <li>Scalable typography and responsive design</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Accessibility was embedded from the ideation phase — high
                    contrast ratios and accessible focus states guided visual
                    design, ensuring inclusivity was built into every page
                    rather than retrofitted at the end.
                </p>

                <h3>2.2 Ethical Principles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anonymised user input for story submissions</li>
                    <li>No manipulative or “dark pattern” design elements</li>
                    <li>Consent for data collection and storage</li>
                    <li>
                        Inclusive imagery representing multiple genders and
                        cultures
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These measures ensure that the platform prioritises
                    wellbeing and self-agency, aligning with ethical principles
                    of transparency and respect.

                <h2>3. Variations from A3 Design Proposal</h2>
                <h3>3.1 Identified Changes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Primary font changed from <em>Michroma</em> to
                        <em>Antonio</em> for improved legibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Animations were simplified to improve browser
                        performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hero image on the Events page was refined for balance
                        and alignment.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.2 Justification for Variations</h3>
                <p>
                    Feedback indicated that <em>Michroma</em> could be difficult
                    to read on smaller screens. <em>Antonio</em> maintains the
                    futuristic style while improving accessibility. Simplified
                    animations reduced visual noise and loading time without
                    losing the overall retro-futurist aesthetic.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3 Conceptual Continuity</h3>
                <p>
                    Despite these changes, the site retains full conceptual and
                    emotional consistency with the A3 design vision — technology
                    remains human-centred, inviting, and reflective of CCI’s
                    identity.

                    <li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Iterative testing and debugging (including assistance
                        from Claude AI).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rapid prototyping in Canva when Figma faced performance
                        issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Version control via GitHub branches to track design and
                        code changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accessibility testing and refinement using browser
                        tools.

                <h3>4.3 Reflection and Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    These challenges deepened my ability to translate creative
                    vision into technical implementation. I learned to iterate
                    quickly and make design trade-offs without sacrificing
                    usability, strengthening my confidence in delivering
                    inclusive, community-driven experiences.

                    The completed site realises the Connect Communities
                    Initiative’s mission of fostering digital belonging through
                    inclusive design, practical interactivity, and aesthetic
                    cohesion. Combining Antonio and Lexend fonts, a
                    teal–blue–green palette, and WCAG-aligned principles, it
                    delivers a retro-futurist yet human-centred experience that
                    empowers users to connect, create, and grow.
