                <h2>1. Acknowledgement of GenAI/MT Use</h2>
                <p>
                    This webpage acknowledges my use of Generative AI and Machine Translation tools
                    in line with the <em>GenAI and MT Usage Framework</em>. I used OpenAI’s ChatGPT
                    and Anthropic’s Claude as creative and technical assistants during the
                    development of my website. These tools supported my workflow across ideation,
                    content drafting, debugging, and accessibility refinement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ChatGPT was used extensively for <strong>structuring content, generating accessible
                    HTML/CSS/JS patterns, refining tone consistency</strong> across pages, and
                    <strong>debugging complex responsiveness issues</strong>. Claude AI was primarily used for
                    <strong>JavaScript troubleshooting and logic clarification</strong> during dynamic content
                    rendering. All code was reviewed, tested, and manually edited by me to ensure
                    alignment with project goals, academic integrity, and user-centred design principles.

                <h2>3. Reflection on GenAI/MT Usage</h2>

                <h3>3.1 Role of GenAI/MT in the Implementation Process</h3>
                <p>
                    GenAI served as an invaluable extension of my creative and technical thinking. It
                    allowed me to test and refine ideas faster, explore alternative approaches to UI
                    structure, and ensure my code adhered to semantic and accessibility standards. By
                    interacting conversationally with ChatGPT, I could validate design logic, compare
                    implementation options, and strengthen my understanding of ARIA integration and
                    responsiveness principles.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 Support for Creativity, Technical Proficiency, and Problem-Solving</h3>
                <p>
                    GenAI accelerated creative decision-making. When I felt stuck translating a concept
                    from Figma into responsive HTML/CSS, I used ChatGPT to break the issue into smaller,
                    solvable components. This process often led to “a-ha” moments that expanded my
                    technical literacy, not diminished it. Similarly, Claude provided clarity on specific
                    JavaScript logic (for instance, filter functionality and modal accessibility). Both tools
                    reduced cognitive friction, letting me stay in a state of creative flow while still
                    critically analysing the results.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3 Challenges Encountered and How They Were Addressed</h3>
                <p>
                    One major challenge was preventing stylistic or structural homogenisation that AI
                    suggestions can cause. I noticed that default AI code tends to be overly verbose or
                    generic. To address this, I imposed strict review cycles — comparing AI-generated code
                    to my original design system (golden ratio spacing, Antonio and Lexend typography)
                    and rewriting segments for brevity, brand cohesion, and maintainability. I also
                    cross-validated technical explanations between ChatGPT and Claude to identify and
                    correct any inconsistencies.
                </p>

                <h3>3.4 Critical Evaluation and Refinement Strategies</h3>
                <p>
                    My strategy was to use GenAI as a <em>thinking partner</em>, not a replacement for
                    skill. I prompted iteratively, refining scope until responses aligned with WCAG 2.1
                    standards and the Connect Communities Initiative’s ethos. I regularly tested all code
                    snippets, edited phrasing for originality, and removed any redundant styling.
                    Ultimately, every output was adapted through human judgment, reflection, and testing.
                </p>

                <h3>3.5 Productivity and Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    Using GenAI enhanced my productivity by streamlining repetitive tasks — especially
                    documentation writing, accessibility auditing, and debug explanations. It reduced time
                    spent searching for syntax errors or revisiting documentation, freeing mental space for
                    higher-order design thinking. Tasks like refining responsive grids, adding aria-labels,
                    and writing alt text were executed more systematically, improving both quality and
                    efficiency.
                </p>

                <h3>3.6 Insights for Future Professional Use</h3>
                <p>
                    This project reaffirmed that when used with transparency and intention, GenAI is a
                    tool for empowerment — not substitution. Going forward, I plan to continue using AI
                    tools ethically in my UX and design research practice, especially for early ideation,
                    accessibility reviews, and technical writing. However, I remain conscious of biases
                    within these systems and the importance of maintaining my own critical voice,
                    creativity, and human oversight.

                <h2>4. Integrity Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    I affirm that the work presented in this assessment is my own and that all uses of
                    Generative AI and Machine Translation tools have been acknowledged transparently and
                    in accordance with the <em>GenAI and MT Usage Framework</em> and the principles of
                    academic integrity. I take full responsibility for critically evaluating, editing, and
                    implementing any AI-assisted content to ensure that authorship, creativity, and ethical
                    standards have been upheld.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Generative AI shaped this project as a collaborative learning experience. Beyond
                    speeding up code iteration and accessibility testing, it became a reflective mirror for
                    how I problem-solve. The final outcome reflects human direction and creativity
                    guided by machine precision.
