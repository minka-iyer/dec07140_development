            <h3>Context and Purpose</h3>
            <p> I used ChatGPT 5.0 to generate an initial HTML/CSS skeleton for the “Design Implications”
            section of my ethics analysis. I had a clear creative vision but needed a starting point, so I used ChatGPT as a launch pad.</p>
            <h3>Critical Decision-making and ownership</h3>
            <p>
                I only used the skeleton to create the grid; I designed the rest myself by adjusting colour and formatting, creating the icons, and writing the text.
                </p>
            <h3> Accuracy, Bias, and Ethical Awareness</h3>
            <p> The AI’s suggested colour scheme wasn’t sufficiently readable, so I changed it to a higher-contrast palette
            aligned with accessibility guidelines and the project style guide.</p>
            <h3>Privacy and Sensitive Content</h3>
            <p>Not Applicable in this case.</p>
            <h3>Reflection on Learning</h3>
            <p>I wanted to try new ways of expressing my creativity and AI-generated code helped me bring my vision to life. I was still in control of the visual and user experience decisions while Chat GPT gave me an understanding of how to structure the visual elements.</p>
        <h3> Attribution and Final Statement</h3>
        <p>I used ChatGPT to support my creative ideas for my website and adapted it where appropriate. All outputs were critically reviewed and integrated, and I maintained control over the creative process and did not use it as a replacement for my own learning. </p>
