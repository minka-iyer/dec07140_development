                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>
                    We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1" tabindex="0">social cohesion</span>
                    by empowering diverse communities to share their stories,
                    connect with others, and access resources that 
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2" tabindex="0">enhance their
                    visibility</span> and influence. Our mission is to strengthen
                    societal bonds by creating platforms that celebrate and
                    support the unique identities of communities across
                    Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams
                    at Connect Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is
                    tasked with developing individual concepts and prototypes
                    for dynamic websites that align with CCI’s mission and
                    vision. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds by
                    creating platforms that celebrate and support the unique
                    identities of communities across Australia.
                </p>
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We are commissioning the development of dynamic,
                    user-friendly websites that represent and support different
                    communities. Each website should serve as a central hub
                    where community members can share resources, highlight
                    events, and foster meaningful connections. The websites must
                    not include any form of commercial activity, such as
                    advertising or selling products. However, it is acceptable
                    to promote resources, events, or services that are directly
                    beneficial to the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The websites must be accessible, mobile-friendly, and
                    reflect the diverse needs of the selected community focus
                    area while adhering to our mission of <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 3" tabindex="0">inclusivity</span>,
                    accessibility, and ethical design. Each website should also
                    celebrate the unique characteristics of its chosen community
                    and support meaningful interaction and engagement.
                </p>
                <h3>Community Focus Areas</h3>

                <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
                <p>Each website must serve two key groups:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Community Members:</strong> Individuals within
                        the selected community who seek representation,
                        resources, and connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>General Audience:</strong> Broader society, who
                        can use the website to learn about the community and its
                        contributions.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Accessibility must be prioritised to ensure seamless
                    interaction for all users, including those relying on
                    assistive technologies.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Project Goals</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Represent and celebrate the identity of the chosen
                        community, recognising and representing the diversity
                        within the community rather than relying on stereotypes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide clear, accessible information and resources to
                        users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Foster meaningful connections and support within the
                        community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure ethical, inclusive, and culturally sensitive
                        design principles are upheld.
