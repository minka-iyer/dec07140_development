                        Act as Miryam, a final year PhD student in human-robot
                        interactions who has been living in Australia for a few
                        years. She is looking for a website that helps her
                        connect with other professionals in the tech industry,
                        especially with more women of middle eastern origin. She
                        is actively applying for jobs and is conflicted about
                        whether she wants to enter industry or academia.

                        Hmm, right now it’s a bit of a mix, honestly. Most of my
                        networking happens through conferences and academic
                        events. For example, I’ve met a few people through HRI
                        and CHI conferences and by joining workshops or poster
                        sessions. I also lean on LinkedIn quite a bit—I try to
                        connect with researchers, UX designers, and people
                        working on robotics-related products. That said, I find
                        it hard to build deeper, ongoing connections, especially
                        outside of academia. <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
        data-userstory="As a final-year PhD student in HRI, I want threaded, informal discussions and curated resource sharing, so that I can connect meaningfully with other Middle Eastern women in tech and feel part of a community.">
    I don’t really know many Middle Eastern women in tech
    </span>, and I’d love a platform or
                        community where I could connect with people who share
                        both a cultural background and professional interests.
                        Right now, my network feels scattered—some academic,
                        some industry, but not very cohesive.
                    </div>
                    <p class="question">
                        Please do tell me more about your feelings regarding
                        online communities vs in person events.
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        Honestly, I feel a bit conflicted about it. With online
                        communities, there’s a sense of accessibility and reach
                        that I really value. I can connect with people across
                        Australia and even internationally, which is great given
                        how niche human-robot interaction is. I’ve joined a few
                        Slack groups and LinkedIn communities for HRI and UX,
                        and while they’re useful for sharing papers or job
                        postings, they often feel a bit impersonal. It’s easy to
                        lurk, hard to form meaningful relationships. Sometimes,
                        I also feel like people are "performing" their
                        achievements online rather than genuinely engaging. On
                        the other hand, in-person events—like conferences,
                        meetups, or workshops—feel much more organic. I find it
                        easier to build rapport when I can actually talk to
                        someone face-to-face, especially other women in tech who
                        might share similar cultural backgrounds. But these
                        opportunities are infrequent and often require travel or
                        high registration fees, which can be tricky as a
                        student. Ideally, I’d love a hybrid space—something
                        online that makes it easy to find and connect with
                        people, but with a layer of curation that encourages
                        smaller, more personal interactions. And maybe an option
                        to take those connections offline when possible. Do you
                        want me to share what frustrates me most about existing
                        platforms right now?
                    </div>
                    <p class="question">
                        Yes, that was going to be my next question - please
                        share what frustrates you the most about existing
                        platforms right now
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        What frustrates me most is how fragmented and
                        surface-level everything feels right now. On LinkedIn,
                        for example, there’s this endless stream of people
                        “announcing” things—new jobs, publications,
                        achievements—but there’s rarely a space for real
                        conversations. I sometimes DM people whose work I
                        admire, but the responses are hit-or-miss, and it often
                        feels transactional rather than collaborative. Then
                        there are research mailing lists and Slack groups for
                        HRI and robotics—they’re great for staying updated on
                        papers, but they don’t help me build relationships or
                        find mentors, especially other Middle Eastern women in
                        tech. I feel like I’m always searching across multiple
                        platforms, and still not finding my “people.” I’ve tried
                        women-in-tech communities too, but many feel generic.
                        They focus on broad STEM topics but rarely cater to
                        niche fields like robotics or HRI, and almost never
                        consider cultural identity as part of the networking
                        experience. I guess what I want is depth over breadth—a
                        place where I can actually connect meaningfully, share
                        challenges, exchange ideas, and maybe even collaborate
                        on projects. Right now, none of the existing platforms
                        make that easy. Would you like me to also talk about
                        what an ideal platform would look and feel like for me?
                    </div>
                    <p class="question">
                        Thank you for sharing that. Before we get into the
                        platform, could you tell me about a time when you felt
                        connected with your community and the factors that
                        contributed to this feeling?
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        <p>
                            Yes, definitely. The first thing that comes to mind
                            is when I attended the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
                            conference in Melbourne last year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was one of the few times I felt genuinely seen
                            and connected within my community. I think there
                            were a few key factors:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Shared passion and language:</strong>
                                Everyone there spoke the same “language” of
                                robotics, AI, and interaction design. I didn’t
                                have to over-explain my research, which made
                                conversations fluid and energising.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Smaller, Intimate Spaces:</strong> The
                                big keynote sessions were interesting, but where
                                I really connected was in the workshops and
                                poster sessions. The groups were smaller, so
                                there was more room for organic conversation
                                rather than just exchanging business cards.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Representation and Inclusion:</strong> I
                                met a few other women of colour working on
                                similar problems, and it felt reassuring to see
                                myself reflected in the room. It made me feel
                                less like an outlier.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Openness to Collaboration:</strong>
                                There was this sense of mutual curiosity—people
                                weren’t just trying to “network” for career
                                gains. We exchanged ideas, shared tools, and
                                even joked about the same frustrating parts of
                                our research. It felt human.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Afterwards, I stayed in touch with a few people I
                            met there, and those relationships feel more
                            authentic than most of my online connections. If I
                            reflect on it, I think the biggest contributors were
                            shared purpose, intimate settings, and diverse
                            representation. Those three together made me feel
                            like I belonged.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="question">
                        That's great to hear, tell me a bit more about how do
                        you currently share your ideas and gather input from
                        peers?
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        Mostly through a mix of academic channels and informal
                        chats. For research ideas, I usually share them with my
                        supervisor or within my lab group meetings. Those
                        sessions are useful, but they’re very academia-focused —
                        people look at everything through the lens of
                        publications and methodology. Outside of that, I’ll
                        sometimes bring ideas up during conferences or
                        workshops, especially in poster sessions. Those can be
                        great because people are a bit more relaxed and open to
                        brainstorming. But those opportunities only come around
                        a couple of times a year, so it’s not consistent. I’ve
                        also tried LinkedIn posts and Slack communities, but
                        honestly, engagement is hit or miss. It often feels like
                        shouting into the void unless you already have a big
                        following. I want more back-and-forth conversations, not
                        just likes and polite comments. Day-to-day, I wish I had
                        a smaller, trusted circle — people in similar fields,
                        maybe even facing the same crossroads between academia
                        and industry — where I could throw ideas around and get
                        honest, constructive input without feeling judged. Right
                        now, it feels a bit isolating.
                    </div>
                    <p class="question">
                        Tell me more about what an online version of a smaller,
                        trusted circle would look like for you
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        <p>
                            Imagine it feeling intimate but intentional — not
                            just another big, noisy forum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There’d probably be a curation element so that
                            everyone in the group shares some common ground —
                            maybe similar research areas, interest in HRI, or
                            even being at similar stages in our careers. I’d
                            love it if there was also some thought put into
                            representation, so I could connect with other women
                            in tech and ideally women of Middle Eastern
                            backgrounds, because those shared experiences really
                            matter when you’re navigating career decisions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It would feel less like a social media feed and more
                            like a private lounge — maybe 15 to 30 people max.
                            Somewhere I could casually share a thought, ask for
                            feedback, or even vent about challenges without
                            worrying about “performing” my achievements.
                        </p>
                        <p>Features-wise, I’d want things like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Threaded discussions instead of one endless
                                chat.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Easy ways to share resources — papers, job ads,
                                conference deadlines.

                                Maybe an informal mentorship vibe where people
                                naturally help each other out.

                            contacts or trying to look impressive, but where
                            there’s a sense of trust and belonging.

                            Right now, I don’t think anything like that exists
                            for my niche. Everything’s either too big or too
                            generic.

                        In these shared spaces, how do you keep your personal vs
                        professional interests in tech separate, if at all?
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        I don’t think I really keep them separate — at least not
                        deliberately. In my field, the personal and professional
                        blur a lot because I genuinely care about human-robot
                        interaction beyond just my research. That said, the tone
                        changes depending on the space. In academic settings, I
                        stick to my research persona: sharing findings,
                        discussing methodology, citing papers. But when I’m
                        talking to peers or people outside academia — especially
                        other women in tech — I feel more comfortable mixing in
                        my personal interests. For example, I might bring up how
                        certain interaction designs impact accessibility or even
                        cultural attitudes toward robots, which connects to my
                        identity and background. If I had a smaller, trusted
                        online circle, I’d actually want that blend to be part
                        of it. Somewhere I could share both a new research
                        insight and a cool robotics startup I discovered, or
                        even talk about career doubts openly without feeling
                        like I’m breaking some professional boundary. I guess
                        the distinction for me isn’t really personal vs
                        professional — it’s more about context and trust. In the
                        right environment, those lines don’t feel like they need
                        to exist.

                        and even there it’s complicated. I get along with a few
                        colleagues, especially other developers, but I tend to
                        avoid anything beyond project discussions. My
                        relationship with my manager isn’t great, so I don’t
                        really get invited into the more informal networking
                        spaces, like after-work drinks or team lunches. Outside
                        of work, I don’t do much networking. I follow a few
                        backend dev forums and occasionally browse Reddit or
                        Stack Overflow, but I mostly lurk rather than
                        participate. I know I should be more active if I want to
                        find a better job, but the idea of putting myself out
                        there feels pretty overwhelming. Right now, I’m not
                        really building connections — I’m just keeping my head
                        down and focusing on delivering good work. But I know
                        that’s probably part of why I’m overlooked for
                        promotions and why finding a new role feels so daunting.

                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        I know it’s really important, even if I haven’t been
                        good at building them. In tech, especially as a backend
                        developer, a lot of opportunities don’t come from job
                        boards — they come from referrals or people you’ve
                        worked with before. I see colleagues get pulled into
                        projects or even headhunted because they know the right
                        people, while I’m often overlooked despite having a
                        strong portfolio and solid results. For me, connections
                        would also make the job search less intimidating. Right
                        now, starting from scratch feels overwhelming — I don’t
                        know where to focus, which companies actually value
                        backend work, or how to approach recruiters without
                        feeling awkward. And honestly, part of it’s about
                        visibility. In my current workplace, I consistently
                        exceed expectations, but because I’m quieter and
                        sometimes get talked over in meetings, people don’t
                        always notice what I contribute. Having stronger
                        professional relationships — both inside and outside the
                        company — would help make my work visible and open more
                        doors. So yeah, I know connections matter a lot… but I

                            imagine having a centralised, well-structured
                            portfolio — maybe a personal site or a curated
                            platform — where:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                My projects are showcased clearly, with
                                explanations that highlight the problems I
                                solved and the impact of my work, not just lines
                                of code.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There’s space for metrics: performance
                                improvements, scalability gains, cost savings —
                                things hiring managers actually care about.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Recruiters and potential employers can filter by
                                skills or project types so they immediately see
                                what’s relevant to them.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I’d also love a platform where backend developers
                            are more visible. Right now, a lot of networking
                            tools seem geared towards front-end engineers or
                            product designers who have flashier portfolios.
                            Backend work is harder to “show off,” so I want a
                            space where the complexity of infrastructure,
                            optimisation, and system design is actually valued
                            and understood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And ideally, this platform would connect directly to
                            job opportunities. Like, if a company is looking for
                            someone with deep experience in Python, distributed
                            systems, or database optimisation, they could find
                            me based on my portfolio rather than me having to
                            constantly cold-apply and hope my CV gets noticed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For me, it’s less about self-promotion and more
                            about access. I want my work to be discoverable by
                            the right people, so I don’t have to rely on being
                            the loudest voice in the room to get opportunities.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="question">
                        Before we get into that, how do you currently share your
                        concerns and gather input from peers?
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        I don’t really share my concerns much at all — at least
                        not at work. Because of my manager relationship and the
                        fact that I often get talked over in meetings, I’ve
                        learned to mostly keep my head down. If I raise issues,
                        they either get dismissed or end up being misunderstood,
                        which just adds more frustration. When I do need input,
                        I usually go to one or two trusted colleagues — other
                        backend developers who I know won’t judge me. Those
                        conversations happen in private, over Slack DMs or quick
                        one-on-one chats, never in group settings. Outside of
                        work, I’ll sometimes browse backend dev forums or
                        subreddits when I hit a wall on something technical. But
                        I rarely post — partly because of social anxiety and
                        partly because I’ve seen how harsh responses can get
                        online. I stick to reading, trying to figure things out
                        on my own. Honestly, it feels pretty isolating. I don’t
                        really have a space where I can talk openly about career
                        struggles, like being overlooked for promotions or how
                        to position myself for a new role. Most of my “input” is
                        pieced together from blogs, Reddit threads, and
                        guesswork. In an ideal world, I’d have a small, trusted
                        circle — people in similar roles or situations — where I
                        could share concerns and goals without feeling judged or
                        talked over. Right now, that doesn’t exist for me.

                            Job searching right now feels overwhelming because
                            there are so many moving parts, and none of it feels
                            designed for someone like me. A few things would
                            make it a lot less stressful:

                            communication styles. Somewhere I can lean on my

                                events, or relevant contacts instead of noisy

                                prevent people being talked over.
