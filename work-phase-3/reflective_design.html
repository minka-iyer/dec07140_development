                    <p>
                        The CCI website projects an identity of authenticity,
                        empowerment, and real-world learning. It supports users
                        in challenging themselves through completing
                        employer-led tasks and developing professional skills
                        while feeling supported and inspired by the community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The emotional tone is calm, inclusive, and motivating —
                        a balance between belonging and ambition. Through its
                        soothing palette and uplifting language, the site
                        inspires users to reflect on their strengths and take
                        confident steps toward personal and professional growth.

                <!-- Example 1 -->

                    <figcaption>
                        <strong>Self-Acceptance:</strong> This image represents
                        self-acceptance and the clarity that comes from knowing
                        one’s strengths before taking on new challenges. The still
                        water and open space symbolise mental calm and readiness to
                        learn. It connects to CCI’s mission by reminding users that
                        meaningful growth — including skill development and career
                        challenges — begins with self-awareness and confidence.

                    <figcaption>
                        <strong>Freedom:</strong> This visual conveys freedom
                        from limitation and the courage to take on new opportunities. 
                        The open sky and upward motion represent ambition — users breaking
                        through barriers and embracing real-world challenges shared by employers.
                        The tone that accompanies this image is energising and affirming, 
                        motivating users to step beyond comfort zones and pursue their goals
                        with independence and optimism.

                        empowerment through community and collaboration. 
                        It mirrors how CCI connects users with mentors, peers, 
                        and organisations offering skill-building opportunities. 
                        The visual language of unity and mutual support reinforces
                        the idea that empowerment is collective — users grow stronger
                        by tackling challenges together and celebrating shared success.

                        through community and collaboration. It mirrors how CCI 
                        connects users with mentors, peers, and organisations

                        the sense of satisfaction and purpose that comes from overcoming 
                        challenges and achieving mastery. It represents the end goal of
                        CCI’s ecosystem: helping users grow through action, reflection,
                        and learning, until they feel confident and grounded in their 
                        achievements. The serene palette evokes balance and gratitude,
                        aligning with CCI’s value of holistic success — both personal and professional.
