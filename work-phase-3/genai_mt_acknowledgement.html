                            I used <strong>ChatGPT (GPT-5)</strong> during the
                            creation of Work Package 3. The
                            tool was primarily used to generate the initial
                            <strong>HTML skeletons</strong> for content-heavy
                            pages such as <em>Behavioural Design</em> and
                            <em>Ethical Response</em>, and to
                            <strong>brainstorm CSS ideas</strong> for layout,
                            accessibility, and visual hierarchy. I also used it
                            to refine written sections such as my ethical
                            analysis and client response for conciseness and
                            clarity.

                        <p>
                            My use of GenAI directly supported my learning goals
                            by helping me understand
                            <strong>semantic HTML structure</strong>,
                            <strong>responsive design</strong>, and
                            <strong>professional documentation style</strong>.
                            Using ChatGPT as a design assistant allowed me to
                            approach the project more efficiently, providing a
                            framework I could adapt and expand. This aligned
                            with the task requirements by enhancing both the
                            <strong>technical accuracy</strong> and
                            <strong>readability</strong> of my submission.

                        <h3 class="value-title">Critical Engagement</h3>
                        <p>
                            I engaged critically with the AI’s output rather
                            than accepting it at face value. I frequently

                            to suit my design identity and academic tone. For
                            example, I added my own creative elements such as
                            <em>annotations in the Reflective Design page</em>
                            and reworked any wording that felt too generic or
                            inconsistent with my project voice. I also evaluated
                            GenAI-generated imagery but chose not to use it, as
                            it did not align with my intended aesthetic or brand
                            identity — instead, I
                            <strong>sourced imagery from Pexels</strong> that
                            better reflected my visual direction.

                            The final website and written content represent my

                            to express an innovative and cohesive brand
                            identity. My <strong>ethical analysis</strong> and
                            proposed solutions were entirely my own; ChatGPT was
                            used only for editorial refinement, not idea
                            generation.

                        <p>
                            Using GenAI tools allowed me to work more
                            iteratively and see alternative ways of structuring
                            both code and written content. It improved my
                            ability to critically assess AI suggestions and
                            decide what aligned with my design intent. I became
                            more confident in identifying
                            <strong>when AI adds value</strong> versus when to
                            rely on my <strong>own creative judgement</strong>.
                            A key challenge was maintaining authenticity while
                            using AI efficiently — a balance I consciously
                            managed by prioritising my own voice, design intuition,
                            and ideas throughout the project.
